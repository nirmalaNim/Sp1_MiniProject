        A pâtisserie (French pronunciation: ​[pɑtisʁi]) is a type of Italian, French or Belgian bakery that specializes in pastries and sweets, as well as a term for such food items. 
        In some countries, it is a legally controlled title that may only be used by bakeries that employ a licensed maître pâtissier in French, meester banketbakker in Dutch, Konditormeister in German (master pastry chef). 
        In Dutch often the word banketbakkerij is used for the shop itself and banketgebak for the confections sold in such an establishment.

        In Italy, France, and Belgium, the pâtissier is a pastry chef who has completed a lengthy training process, typically an apprenticeship, and passed a written examination.[1] Often found in partnership with a boulangerie in French, bakkerij in Dutch, Bäckerei in German (bakery), pâtisseries are a common sight in towns in Italy, France, and Belgium. Cakes and other sweet foods can be bought at a pâtisserie.  </p>

    <p class = "para1-a" style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(247, 243, 243); font-size: xx-large; font-family: Calibri;">The types of cakes we see today at the best Gibraltar bakeries with icing only came about thanks to 17th Century technology.
         Sugar was more widely available for the first time, ovens became more reliable and cake hoops made of metal, paper or wood were in use for the first time.
          The first icing was created from sugar, egg whites and flavouring, before being poured on cakes.</p>

    <p class="para2" style="text-align: justify; color:white;font-family: Calibri;">Finally, in the 19th century refined white flour was combined with baking powder – that replaced yeast – to take cake-making to the next level. 
        The first cake chef, Antonin Careme, pushed the cake along its path, with his ‘gateaux’, much richer cakes which were more intricate in style and taste. Indeed, butter-cream frosting, (that used cream with butter and finer sugar) 
        started to become the norm in the early 1900s. Cake mixes became more common in United States during the Great Depression of the 1930s</p>
    <br>

    <p class="para3" style="text-align: justify; color: white;font-family: Calibri;">Before there was catering for corporate events, birthday parties and special events, cakes were used to commemorate religious festivals and ceremonies. 
        Circles were used to signify the sun and moon, as well as the cyclical nature of life. It could be why the same styles are used for birthday parties in Gibraltar and event cakes. 
        They were often shaped like animals too or contained ingredients which were seasonal to the time, helping them celebrate their affinity to the period. </p>
